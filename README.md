# Majibo

* Static site generator written in Python
* Designed for my personal purposes
* No database, content is based on markdown files
* Useful shortcodes for images, YouTube videos and other stuff
* Fast and secure! Of course, because it produces only static HTML sites :-)

Majibo is a japan world for... just kidding. The name is just an acronym of used components:

* **ma**rkdown
* **ji**nja templates
* **bo**otstrap
