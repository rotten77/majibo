# Majibo

* Static site generator written in Python
* Designed for my personal purposes
* No database, content is based on markdown files
* Useful shortcodes for images, YouTube videos and other stuff
* Fast and secure! Of course, because it produces only static HTML sites :-)

Majibo is a japan world for... just kidding. The name is just an acronym of names of libraries and modules that I used:

* **ma** = markdown (content, syntax)
* **ji** = jinja (templating)
* **bo** = bootstrap (CSS)
